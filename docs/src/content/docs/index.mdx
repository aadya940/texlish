<b><i>Texlish</i></b> combines the best of
<b>LaTeX</b>, <b>Markdown</b>, and <b>indentation sensitivity</b>
to offer a clean, easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax.

Texlish <b>compiles to LaTeX</b>, so it's compatible with
all existing packages, and you can submit to journals, arXiv, etc. as usual.

Texlish also aims to be <b>99% LaTeX compatible</b>:
you can write/import regular LaTeX,
and gradually transition to Texlish's cleaner syntax at your own pace.

Try Texlish for your next document, paper, or presentation!
