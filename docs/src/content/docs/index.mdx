***Texlish*** combines the best of
**LaTeX**, **Markdown**, and **indentation sensitivity**
to offer a clean, easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax.

Texlish **compiles to LaTeX**, so it's compatible with
all existing packages, and you can submit to journals, arXiv, etc. as usual.

Texlish also aims to be **99% LaTeX compatible**:
you can write/import regular LaTeX,
and gradually transition to Texlish's cleaner syntax at your own pace.

Try Texlish for your next document, paper, or presentation!
