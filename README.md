# texlish

## Development

To get started:

1. Check out this repo
2. `corepack enable`
3. `pnpm install`
4. `pnpm build`
5. `pnpm link -g` to install global `texlish`

Repeat Steps 3-4 to build the current version.
(Step 3 is necessary only if `package.json` has changed.)

To run: `texlish filename` (generates `filename.tex`)
